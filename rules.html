            There are many valuable rules in html that you need to know properly. Now, I invite you to follow these instructions.
        </p>
        <p>
            I made this list to make it easier for you to understand.
        </p>
        <nav>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Define a DOCTYPE at a very top.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You need to define also an html lang attribute to identify the language of text content on the web.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You can’t have an end tag without a start tag.
                </li>
                <li> 
                    If you set a starting tag, you need an end tag as well or a closing tag as it known after the content.
                    Tags are always surrounded by angle brackets (less-than/greater-than characters).
                    And the end tag or second tag—the <q>switch</q>—always starts with a forward slash.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Every starting tag needs:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Start with a <code>&lt;</code>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            End with a <code>&gt;</code>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Every ending tag needs:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Start with a <code>&lt;/</code>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            End with a <code>&gt;</code>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use <code>src</code> attribute for an image.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Void elements do not anticipate a closing tag.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You should use lowercase for the element name.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Do never use less-than/greater-than inside the tag and never use also double quote inside of double quote
                </li>
                <li>
                    Nest your elements properly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Make sure that you indent a child element very well.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use the element as it is ment for, in case there will be a problem. In another word, there are some elements that can't be as a child of another element. For examle, element <q>div</q> is not allowed as a child of element <q>label</q> and element <q>a</q> is not allowed as a child of element <q>ul</q> in some contexts. There are a lot of them, so you need be careful.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </nav>
