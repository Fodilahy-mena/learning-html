        </p>
        <p>
          It represents the contact information for its enclosing section.
          If it is a child of the body element, then it applies to the document as a whole.

        </p>
        <p>
          It represents either a hyperlink with some text and a corresponding area on an image map, or a dead area on an image map.
          If the area element has no href attribute, then the area represented by the element cannot be selected, and the alt attribute must be omitted.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
          It allows a user to reprent a section of a page which consists of a composition that forms
          an independent part of a document, page oe site. For examples a forum post, a magazine, a user-submitted
          comment.
        </p>
      </dd>

        </p>
        <p>
          It allows a user to reprent a section of a page consisting of content that is tangentially related to the content around the aside element, and which could be considered separate from that content. Such sections are often represented as sidebars in printed typography.
        </p>
      </dd>

        </p>
        <p>
          It allows a user to reprent a sound or audio stream.
          Content may be nested inside the audio element. User agents should not show this content to the user. Authors should use this content to force older browsers to use a legacy audio plugin or to inform the user of how to access the audio content.
        </p>
      </dd>
      <!-- Add the next element here as a <dt> & <dd> pair -->

          The b element (<code>&lt;b&gt;</code>) is one of the fundamental elements in the HTML.
        </p>
        <p>
          It allows a user to represent a span of text to be stylistically offset from the normal prose without
          conveying any extra importance.
          Examples are key words in a document abstract, product names in a review, or other spans of text whose typical
          typographic presentation is bold.
        </p>
      </dd>
      <dt>
        <code>&lt;base&gt;</code>

          The base element (<code>&lt;base&gt;</code>) is one of the fundamental elements in the HTML.
        </p>
        <p>
          It allows authors to specify the document base URL for the purposes of resolving relative URLs, and the name of the default browsing context for the purposes of following hyperlinks. The element does not represent any content beyond this information.
          There must be no more than one base element per document. A base element must have either an href attribute, a target attribute, or both.
        </p>
      </dd>
      <dt>
        <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code>

          The blockquote element (<code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code>) is one of the fundamental elements in the HTML.
        </p>
        <p>
          It represents a section that is quoted from another source.
          Content inside a blockquote must be quoted from another source, whose address, if it has one, may be cited in the cite attribute.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
          It represents a line break. br elements must be used only for line breaks that are actually part of the content, as in poems or addresses. br elements must not be used for separating thematic groups in a paragraph.
        </p>
      </dd>
      <dt>
        <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          The button element (<code>&lt;button&gt;</code>) is one of the fundamental elements in HTML.
        </p>
        <p>
          It allows a user to show a button on a document, and if the button is disabled, then the user agent
          should allow the user to activate the button.
        </p>
      </dd>
      <dt>
        <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          The canvas element (<code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>) is one of the fundamental elements in HTML.
        </p>
        <p>
          It represents a resolution-dependent bitmap canvas, which can be used for rendering graphs, game graphics, or other visual images on the fly.
          Authors should not use the canvas element in a document when a more suitable element is available. For example, it is inappropriate to use a canvas element to render a page heading. If the desired presentation of the heading is graphically intense, it should be marked up using appropriate elements (typically h1) and then styled using CSS and supporting technologies such as XBL.
          When authors use the canvas element, they must also provide content that, when presented to the user, conveys essentially the same function or purpose as the bitmap canvas. This content should be nested within the canvas element as a fallback.
        </p>
      </dd>
      <dt>
        <code>&lt;caption&gt;</code>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          The caption element (<code>&lt;caption&gt;</code>) is one of the fundamental elements in HTML.
        </p>
        <p>
          It allows a user to represent the title of a table which is its parent, if it has a parent and
          thah is a table element.
        </p>
      </dd>
      <dt>
        <code>&lt;cite&gt;</code>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          The cite element (<code>&lt;cite&gt;</code>) is one of the fundamental elements in HTML.
        </p>
        <p>
          It represents the title of a work (e.g. a book, a paper, an essay, a poem, a score, a song, a script, a film, a TV show, a game, a sculpture, a painting, a theatre production, a play, an opera, a musical, an exhibition, a legal case report, etc). This can be a work that is being quoted or referenced in detail (i.e. a citation), or it can just be a work that is mentioned in passing.
          A person's name is not the title of a work — even if people call that person a piece of work — and the element must therefore not be used to mark up people's names. (In some cases, the b element might be appropriate for names; e.g. in a gossip article where the names of famous people are keywords rendered with a different style to draw attention to them. In other cases, if an element is really needed, the span element can be used.)
        </p>
      </dd>
      <dt>
        <code>&lt;code&gt;</code>
      </dt>
      <dd>

          The col element (<code>&lt;col&gt;</code>) is one of the fundamental elements in HTML.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a col element has a parent and that is a colgroup element that itself has a parent that is a table element, then the col element represents one or more columns in the column group represented by that colgroup.
        </p>
      </dd>
      <dt>
        <code>&lt;colgroup&gt;</code>

          The colgroup element (<code>&lt;colgroup&gt;</code>) is one of the fundamental elements in HTML.
        </p>
        <p>
          The colgroup element represents a group of one or more columns in the table that is its parent, if it has a parent and that is a table element.
          If the colgroup element contains no col elements, then the element may have a span content attribute specified, whose value must be a valid non-negative integer greater than zero.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
          The command element represents a command that the user can invoke. A command can be part of a context menu or toolbar, using the menu element, or can be put anywhere else in the page, to define a keyboard shortcut.

        </p>
        <p>
          The datalist element represents a set of option elements that represent predefined options for other controls. The contents of the element represents fallback content for legacy user agents, intermixed with option elements that represent the predefined options. In the rendering, the datalist element represents nothing and it, along with its children, should be hidden.
          The datalist element is hooked up to an input element using the list attribute on the input element.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
          It represents a removal from the document.

        </p>
        <p>
          The dfn element represents the defining instance of a term. The paragraph, description list group,

      </dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          The division element (<code>&lt;div&gt;</code>) is one of the fundamental elements in HTML.
        </p>
        <p>
          It doesn't really have special meaning at all, but what it does is to represent it s
          children and it can be used with the class and lang.
        </p>
      </dd>

        </p>
        <p>
          It represents stress emphasis of its contents.
          The level of emphasis that a particular piece of content has is given by its number of ancestor em elements.
          The 'stress' being referred to is linguistic.
          If spoken, this stress would be emphasised pronunciation on a word that can change the nuance of a sentence.
        </p>

        <p>
          The fieldset element is expected to establish a new block formatting context.
          If the fieldset element has a child that matches the conditions in the list below, then the first such child is the fieldset element's rendered legend:
          The child is a legend element.
          The child is not out-of-flow (e.g. not absolutely positioned or floated).
          The child is generating a box (e.g. it is not 'display:none').

        </p>
        <p>
          The figure element represents some flow content, optionally with a caption, that is self-contained and is typically referenced as a single unit from the main flow of the document.
          The figure element can be used to annotate illustrations, diagrams, photos, code listings, etc., that are referenced in the main content of the document, but that could, without affecting the flow of the document, be moved away from that primary content — e.g., to the side of the page, to dedicated pages, or to an appendix.

          The header element (<code>&lt;header&gt;</code>) is one of the fundamental elements in HTML.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is typically used to group a set of h1–h6 elements to mark up a page's title with its subtitle or tagline.
          header elements may, however, contain more than just the section's headings and subheadings — e.g.,
          version history information or publication date.

        </p>
        <p>
          It represents a paragraph-level thematic break. The "paragraph-level" bit means between blocks of text, so it can't be used to separate sections of a site. Instead, hr now separates different topics within a section of prose, or between scenes in a novel.

        <p>
          It represents a span of text in an alternate voice or mood,
          or otherwise offset from the normal prose, such as a taxonomic designation, a technical term,
          an idiomatic phrase from another language, a thought, a ship name, or some other prose whose typical
          typographic presentation is italicized.

          It is used to represent a nested browsing context.
          For iframe elements in HTML documents, the attribute, if present,
          must have a value using the HTML syntax that consists of the following syntactic components,
          in the given order:
          Any number of comments and space characters.
          Optionally, a DOCTYPE.
          Any number of comments and space characters.
          The root element, in the form of an html element.

        <p>
          It allows a user to put an image. The image given by the src attribute is the embedded content,
          and the value of the alt attribute is the img element's fallback content.
          The src attribute must be present, and must contain a valid non-empty URL potentially
          surrounded by spaces referencing a non-interactive, optionally animated,
          image resource that is neither paged nor scripted.

          The kbd element (<code>&lt;kbd&gt;</code>) is one of the fundamental elements in HTML.
        </p>
        <p>
          The kbd element represents user input (typically keyboard input, although it may also be used to represent other input, such as voice commands).
          When the kbd element is nested inside a samp element, it represents the input as it was echoed by the system. When the kbd element contains a samp element, it represents input based on system output, for example invoking a menu item.
          When the kbd element is nested inside another kbd element, it represents an actual key or other single unit of input as appropriate for the input mechanism.

        </p>
        <p>
          It allows authors to link their document to other resources and it also allows
          reviewer to gain more informatio by clicking the link.
          The destination of the link(s) is given by the href attribute,
          which must be present and must contain a valid non-empty URL potentially surrounded by spaces.

          The main element (<code>&lt;main&gt;</code>) is one of the fundamental elements in HTML.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main element is an exact analogue of ARIA's role="main",
          and is designed to show screenreaders and assistive technologies exactly where main content begins,
          so it can be a target for a "skip links" keyboard command, for example.
          It could also be used for content syndication (Instapaper-ish things);
          mobile browsers could zoom in on main when encountering non-responsive websites.
          It should therefore be used once per page.

        </p>
        <p>
           It represents a run of text in one document marked or highlighted because of its relevance in another context.
           When used in a quotation or other block of text referenced in a document, it indicates a highlight that was not present in the original document — e.g., a portion of text in an academic publication that has recently come under additional scrutiny.

        </p>
        <p>
          The menu element represents a list of commands.
          If a menu element's type attribute is in the context menu state, then the element represents the commands of a context menu, and the user can only interact with the commands if that context menu is activated. If a menu element's type attribute is in the toolbar state, then the element represents a list of active commands that the user can immediately interact with.
          If a menu element's type attribute is in the list state, then the element either represents an unordered list of items (each represented by an li element), each of which represents a command that the user can perform or activate, or, if the element has no li element children, flow content describing available commands.

        <p>
          The meta element represents various kinds of metadata that cannot be expressed using the title,
          base, link, style, and script elements.
          The meta element can represent document-level metadata with the name attribute,
          pragma directives with the http-equiv attribute,
          and the file's character encoding declaration when an HTML document is serialized to string form
          (e.g. for transmission over the network or for disk storage) with the charset attribute.

        <p>
          When the meter binding applies to a meter element, the element is expected to render as an 'inline-block' box with a 'height' of '1em' and a 'width' of '5em', a 'vertical-align' of '-0.2em', and with its contents depicting a gauge.
          When the element is wider than it is tall(or square), the depiction is expected to be of a horizontal gauge, with the minimum value on the right if the 'direction' property on this element has a computed value of 'rtl', and on the left otherwise. When the element is taller than it is wide, it is expected to depict a vertical gauge, with the minimum value on the bottom.

        <p>
          It is used to represent navigation for a document.
          The nav element is a section containing links to other documents or to parts within the current document.
          Not all groups of links on a page need to be in a nav element — only groups of primary navigation links.
          In particular, it is common for footers to have a list of links to various key parts of a site,
          but the footer element is more appropriate in such cases.

        <p>
          It represents nothing if scripting is enabled, and represents its children if scripting is disabled. It is used to present different markup to user agents that support scripting and those that don't support scripting, by affecting how the document is parsed.

        <p>
          The optgroup element represents a group of option elements with a common label. The element's group of option elements consists of the option elements that are children of the optgroup element.
          When showing option elements in select elements, user agents should show the option elements of such groups as being related to each other and separate from other option elements.

          In certain circumstances described in the definition of the select element,
          an option element can be a select element's placeholder label option. A placeholder label option does not
          represent an actual option,
          but instead represents a label for the select control.

            It represents the result of a calculation.
            The optional for attribute allows an explicit relationship to be made between the result of a calculation and the elements representing the values that influenced the calculation.

        </p>
        <p>
          The source element allows authors to specify multiple alternative media resources for media elements.
          It does not represent anything on its own. The src attribute gives the address of the media resource.
          The value must be a valid non-empty URL potentially surrounded by spaces. This attribute must be present.

        <p>
          The title element represents the document's title or name.
          Authors should use titles that identify their documents even when they are used out of context,
          for example in a user's history or bookmarks, or in search results.
          The document's title is often different from its first heading,
          since the first heading does not have to stand alone when taken out of context.
