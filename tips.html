        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Always close your tag</b>, in case it will spend your time to turn back to it when there is an error. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Style your <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> using style sheets wherever possible</b>, because style sheets will make your HTML coding life so much easier. <em>But I do not recommend you to use any other style</em> if you don't know how to use them appropriately. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Use a code editor</b> that has auto-completion. Auto-completion allows you to start typing a tag or attribute and the software predicts what you’re typing and finishes it for you. This means you can type just a couple of characters and the return key to type considerably longer bits of code.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Make you work as simple as it could be</b> but it is clean, legible and comprehensible.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Use tab key</b> when you work on gitbush and do not forget to utilize keyboard shortcuts as many as you know. It can hell you to work quicker in visual studio code and even with another browsers.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Use an <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> validator</b>. It’s a great idea to run your Web pages through an HTML validator before you publish them on your Website. These programs will pick up potential problems such as missing closing tags on tables, and using tags that won’t work properly on all browsers. Don’t forget – just because your page looks great in the browser you’re viewing it with doesn’t mean it will work on other browsers!. <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> validators are also a good way to learn about the correct way to use HTML tags – you can learn from your mistakes!
