            <b>Nesting</b> is a way of putting HTML <b>elements</b> within other <b>elements</b> in the proper order. Each <b>element</b> must be fully contained within its parent <b>element</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>
                There are some rules of <b>nesting</b> html which help you to make a good code, so I want you to not forget this list.
            </i>
        </p>
    <nav>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Put your code in the right order, in case it won't work. What I mean about this is when you've defined <b>DOCTYPE</b>, make sure that all of your nesting elements are inside of the <b>html</b> element. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Define the <b>head</b> element as the origine of your code.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the <b>head</b> element, you must need a <b>title</b> element as its child.
            </li>
            <li>
                Each siblings must be in the same <mark>indenting</mark>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Make sure that your <em>child</em> element tag is closed before you close the parent element. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Your code maight have many sections inside the body element, so put them in order as well. For example, <b>header, main</b> and <b>footer</b>.  
            </li>
            <li>
                Becareful there are some elements called void elements that do not have a closing tag and therefore cannot have content placed inside them, so what does this mean is they make no nest.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <mark><q>Don't ever do this if you want a good code!.</q></mark>
